# SortingVisualizer
Hello there!

This sorting visualizer is created through JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
The program can be run locally in browser by downloading the repo and clicking on file index.html.
The sorting visualizer is able to take in user input of different array sizes and sorting speeds,
and sort the input (values represented visually as bars) using Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, and Bubble Sort.

WORK IN PROGRESS!
